# üöó Electric Vehicle Data Analysis and Visualization

## üìå Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends using **geospatial, statistical, and machine learning techniques**. It visualizes vehicle population distributions, tracks historical adoption trends, and evaluates EV characteristics such as **price, range, and charging station accessibility**.
